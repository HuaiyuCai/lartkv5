<h2>Brief description</h2>
This description deals with a mechanism to control
the laser3D on the Atlascar.

<h2>System operation</h2>
The system is designed to rotate a 2D laser about a shaft
which is perpendicular to the scannerâ€™s internal mirror axle.
The scanner is in forward looking position because it is to be
installed onboard a robot with a prevalent sense of motion.
To rotate the external shaft, a stepper motor is used with its
angular velocity controlled by an MCU. In order to establish
connection between the rotating scanner and the fixed part
of the platform, a slip ring with adequate signal to noise
ratio and power capability has been installed. [R.Pascoal]
