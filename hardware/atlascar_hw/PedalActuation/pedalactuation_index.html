<h2>Brief description</h2>
This description deals with a mechanism to actuate the brake
and clutch pedals on the Atlascar.

<h2>System operation</h2>
[Long description]<br>
Uses comercial boxes driven by electrical signals from a PLC ... bla

<h2>Mechanical components</h2>
[conceptual mechanism, Drawings of fixing and supporting systems...]<br>
Pedals are pushed by a mechanical arrangement of cables and pulleys.<br>

<h2>Electrical circuits</h2>
[Electrical circuits of the devices - use images to illustrate]<br>
The main pedal actuator has the following wiring (Wrong, do not be
fooled... :-))<br>

The boxes have internal microcontrollers to operate the system<br>
<h2>Firmware and similar code<br>
</h2>
[Describe what programs and environments are used alogn with links to
relevant code]<br>
Microcontroller board is PIC-based and has the following <br>
main program: <a href="Code/brake/brake_pic_code.c">brake PIC code<br>
</a><br>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
[Here lay specific instructions for technitians and engineers]<br>
The system requires calibration procedures each time the boxes are
moved.<br>
